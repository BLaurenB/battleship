This is the game BATTLESHIP!
Be the first to sink your opponent's ships!

Choose your ship locations. You have one ship that takes 2 board-spaces, and another that takes 3 spaces.

Ships can be placed vertically or horizontally on the board in a straight line, but they cannot overlap or be placed diagonnaly.

When prompted, enter the coordinates of your ships like this:
A1 A2 A3

Once you and your opponent have placed your ships, you will take turns firing shots into enemy territory. After each shot you'll see the player board updated to show whether you hit an enemy ship or missed. When prompted, enter your shot like this:
C4

When a player has Hit all the opponents' ship coordinates, that player wins!
